      ### Why three columns?

      Columns and grid layout is a common pattern<br>in web design that spans many site types.

      We need to put your fresh RWD skills to work!

      Our code should look something like this:

      ```html
        <section id="main-content">
        <h3>...</h3>
        <section class="column">
        <img src="images/africa.png" alt="Africa">
        <h4>My Home</h4>
        <p>Wild zebras live in Africa.</p>
        <a href="home.html" class="btn">See my home</a>
        </section>
        <!-- Repeat .column x3 -->
        </section>
      ```

      Now that we have our 3 content areas, we want them to appear next to each other when there is enough screen space. We can do this by floating them all left.

      ```css
      @media (min-width: 44em) {
        .column {
          float: left;
          width: 33.333%;
          padding: 1em;
        }
      }
      ```

      We used 33.333%, because that is one third of 100%. Don’t forget padding to give the columns some space.

      ### Uh, oh. Those columns aren’t working.
      <div class="grid grid-1-2 grid-stretch util-margin-t1">
      <div>
        <p>We need some extra CSS to redefine the box model. By default padding adds to the size of a container. Instead of a container with a width of `33.333%`, the width is<br>`33.333% + 2em`.</p>
        <p>`box-sizing` to the rescue!</p>
      </div>
      <div>
      ```css
      @media (min-width: 44em) {
        .column {
          float: left;
          width: 33.333%;
          padding: 1em;
          box-sizing: border-box;
        }
      }
      ```
      </div>
      </div>

      ### Wow. Large Images.

      Our responsive `max-width: 100%;` lets the image grow until it hits the edge of the container. In this case, we want the image to be a little bit smaller than the container.

      ```css
      .column img {
        width: 70%;
      }
      ```

      There we go!

      Let’s add a border radius to it too, because we ❤️ circles

      ```css
      .column img {
        width: 70%;
        border-radius: 50%;
        border: 0.3125em solid #5C4B82;
        margin-bottom: 1.25em;
      }
      ```

      We’ve got our 3 column layout set, our images are scaled based on the width of the column, but our columns are still bumping against the edges of the browser.
      </div>
      <div>
      ```html
      <section id="main-content">
        <div class="container">
          <h3>...</h3>
          <section class="column">
          ...

          <section class="column">

      </section>
      ```
      </div>
