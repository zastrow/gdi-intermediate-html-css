## Building the slide deck:

The slide deck is available as is and ready to run in the `docs` directory. A Node-base build process has been built around the slide deck to allow the deck to be broken down into manageable chunks, as well as Sass for CSS generation.

- To install Node modules run `npm install`
- To generate and serve the slide deck run `npm start`


## Course description

Through the course of this four-part class, you'll get a thorough introduction to HTML5 and CSS3 to build on your previous knowledge. You'll get hands-on experience working with HTML5 features like semantic elements and forms, and you'll learn new CSS3 properties and abilities including transformations and transitions. Finally, we'll dig into responsive design and browser compatibility.

You'll leave with readily-applicable skills and we'll be there to answer any questions you may have along the way!

To get the most out of this class, you should have a working knowledge of basic HTML and CSS. You may have taken Intro to HTML through Girl Develop It, or maybe you have built a site for fun.
